"""
Generate the categorization review file for unknown transactions.

`tally up` writes its report, then calls generate_categorization() to emit
`config/categorization.yaml` plus a JSON Schema that drives editor autocomplete.
The user answers in an editor at their own pace; an agent reads the file back and
applies the answers by editing merchants.rules and the user's tagging column.

Tally only ever *generates* this file. It has no rules-file writer and never
reads anything an agent owns beyond carrying user-authored fields forward.
